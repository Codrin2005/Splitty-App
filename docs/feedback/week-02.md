# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 

> The agenda was added into the repository in time. The template was correctly followed and the individual points were clearly formulated. As a tip, please also include some time at the beginning for TA announcements.

> You follow the old template (the one from Gitlab) instead of the new one presented in the assignment. For this week that's okay, but starting next week please use the updated (and shorter by the way) agenda template.

> The individual points in the agenda were clear. For next week, I would come up with more topics related to coding (planning issues for example).


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:

> The chair ensured all topics were covered with the right amount of depth. I liked that you coordinated the meeting without overpowering it and that you engaged other teammates in the discussion, good work.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:

> You took ownership of the meeting organically, which is great. Everybody seems to be comfortable enough to share their ideas and be involved in the discussion. The overall athmosphere is constructive, but I would have liked to see a bit more enthusiasm about the actual coding part.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback:

> I liked that you already split the general tasks for this week (database work, endpoints work, etc.) during this meeting.I, however, expected more progress last week in terms of the application, such as discussing the backlog, making a more in depth planning, maybe some wireframes/database schema etc. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 

> There seems to be more or less equal contribution from each teammate. I liked that you are almost finished with the Code of Conduct and that you took the assignment seriously.

> Starting next week, please save some time in the agenda to discuss what you did last week so I have a clear overview of your progress.
