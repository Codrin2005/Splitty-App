## Formative Assessment
*Grading scale: Insufficient - Sufficient - Good - Excellent*

#### 1) Self-organization - Good

I liked that by the end of the meeting, you took some control over the discussion when talking about the requirements of the project. For next week, I would suggest for everybody to be engaged in the discussion and share their opinions, so please do not hesitate to say your viewpoint.

#### 2) Suggested Topics - Good

The suggested topics were covered, especially the backlog part, but under my guidance. Again, please lead the discussion yourselves next time.
