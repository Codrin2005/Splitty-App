# Meeting notes
- Start implementing real features
- Only merge request to main count towards knockout criteria
- Merge counts only if the pipeline is successful
- The knockout criteria is the minimum contribution you can add
- Renaming classes/methods to add lines is fraud
- Check email to see if we passed the knockout criteria
- change the participant to be a weak entity instead of a strong entity.
- we should plan milestones week per week, monday to sunday.
- use websockets for the expenses
- use api for emailing.
- use json for config files
- mockito for testing
