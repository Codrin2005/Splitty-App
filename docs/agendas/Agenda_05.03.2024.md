# TA announcements
- We failed the knock out criteria. Main reason was that we didn't "approve" of any merge requests. <br>
Solution: We changed the settings so that we had to approve of a Merge request before it could be merged.
- More ways to use gitlab, notably:
    - Time tracking, we can put time estimates on issues, as well as tracking the total time for each member.
    - We can also see how accurate those time estimates were, and how much time we actually spent per issue.
    - We can automatically associate a branch with an issue, by precising the issue number in the branch name. This allows gitlab to automatically close the issue as soon as the branch is merged.
    - We can also add descriptions to our merge requests, which we might want to look into, in order to improve clarity.
    - Finally the Buddy Check is important, we should attempt to fill in every text box, as leaving anything blank is not a good sign.

# Hindsight for last week. How we can improve.
- As previously stated, we must remember to approve of each other's merge requests, however with the new setting in place, this should be quite doable.
- We had trouble with our milestones and issues as many of us forget to close the issues once they are done. This makes it harder to track each other's milestones and understand what each of us is doing. <br>
Solution: We must remember to actually close our issues after completing them. <br> (or simply add our issue number to our branch, so it closes automatically after each merge request)
- Finally, there was a small problem in our participant's endpoint, which will be solved this week.

# Action points for next week
- Resolving the problem for our participant endpoint.
- Start working with Mockito and test the back end.
- Work on the expense Scenes, and see if/how we implement tags.
- Finsih up the invite code features.
- Finish the editing debts scene.

# Roles for next week
- Codrin: Will work on the expense scenes and the tags (tags for the expenses)
- Tijmen: Will create a scene to resolve/edit debts. <br>
(if he has time he will help Codrin with tags)
- Georges & Calin: Will work on finishing the edit/add participants scene as well as back end
- Riad & Calin: Will work on the testing with Mockito.
- Andrei: Will join the invite code features.
