# Code of Conduct review remarks:
- Bolding keywords is crucial (bolding has been now added to the 'Shared Values' paragraph)
- Grammar has been corrected using Grammarly
- Mentioning the questions that our Code of Conduct answers is redundant
- It is necessary that we standardise the use of the 1st person plural pronoun
- Repeated 'trust-based system' references
- Possible that we take a look at the 'teamwork' lecture


# Assigning roles for next week:
- Tijmen, Riad - Database design
- Calin - Choose checkstyle
- Georges, Calin, Codrin - Study the backlog
- Full team - Design the skeleton, models classes

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Coding assessment begins this week (W2)
- MVC has been chosen as the app architecture
